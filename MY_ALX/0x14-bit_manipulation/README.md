The statement "The bitwise operators are used to manipulate the bits of integral operands both signed and unsigned" means that bitwise operators are a set of operators in computer programming that allow you to perform operations at the level of individual binary digits (bits) within integer values. These operators can be applied to both signed and unsigned integer data types.

Let's break down the statement:

Bitwise Operators: These are special operators in programming languages, such as C, C++, Java, and others, that work at the binary level. They allow you to perform various operations like AND, OR, XOR, shifting, and complementing on the individual bits of integers.

Manipulate the Bits: Bitwise operators allow you to modify or manipulate the binary representation of integer values by performing specific operations on their individual bits. For example, you can change specific bits from 0 to 1 or vice versa, combine bits from different values, or extract specific bits from an integer.

Integral Operands: Integral operands refer to integer data types, both signed and unsigned. In most programming languages, integral data types include int, long, short, char, and their variations, as well as their unsigned counterparts like unsigned int, unsigned long, etc. These data types store whole numbers (integers) and are commonly used in programming.

Signed and Unsigned: Integral operands can be either signed or unsigned. Signed integers can represent both positive and negative values, while unsigned integers are used only for non-negative values (zero and positive). Bitwise operators can be applied to both types of integers, allowing you to work with their binary representations regardless of whether they represent positive or negative numbers.

In summary, the statement is emphasizing that bitwise operators are versatile tools for working with the binary representation of integer values, and they can be used with both signed (positive and negative) and unsigned (non-negative) integer data types in programming.
